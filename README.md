## Project Structure

To maintain a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase, I've adhered to best practices by organizing the project into separate repositories for the frontend and backend components.

- Backend Repository: [https://github.com/kumaraswini-11/backend-tensorgo]
- Frontend Repository: [https://github.com/kumaraswini-11/frontend-tensorgo]

## Setup and Running the Application

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory and install all the dependencies:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Create a .env file in the backend directory and set up the required environment variables as specified in the .env.sample file. Ensure that sensitive variables are managed securely.

3. Start the backend server:

```sh
npm start
```

### Frontend

Similarly, navigate to the frontend directory, install all the dependencies & start the development server for the frontend.

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
